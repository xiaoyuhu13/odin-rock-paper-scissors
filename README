- to pass in parameters to a function in addEventListener need to use an anonymous function...
- reading through official documentation is helpful!

-alternate solution could be appending h1 and p tags into the div instead of changing the textContent
-this would make it easier to style with css in future iterations
-first create p element
-then add textContent
-then add to div
-need to remove once other buttons pressed?
